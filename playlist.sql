Right then I realized that no\n      contemporary band will ever get a reception like that again, does it take a repressed age to recieve\n      such an ovation? Dont get me wrong, I see bands get the screaming girl thing all the time, but its\n      different now - it lacks the same intensity as wildly screaming teens in the 1950s, an almost\n      involuntary state that only shows itself when you truly desire something. This got me thinking more and\n      I started wondering if shit like justin bieber was our modern day beatle? If that''s the current state of\n      music I want nothing to do with it,the two states of music always boggle my mind, music: which is what\n      you hear places like KCRW, stereo gum, and here - then there''s Music which panders to the teenage heart\n      with mommy and daddy''s credit card in a paper envelope in their pocket. -- See that folks? there''s more\n      going on in my head than just dick jokes.

Now assuming you arn''t lactose intolerant.. cause if you are you just shit your pants..\n      but if you aren''t you just experienced what I can only presume unicorn turds taste like. Now lets not\n      forget these dudes still believed in witches(sort of) and of course ol Theodore across the table isn''t\n      having it. The macaroni is too good - Teddy stands up "JEFFERSON, WHAT IS THIS WIZARDRY!?"
