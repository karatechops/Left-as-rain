    <h1>About left as rain</h1>
    <p class="copy">
        Left as rain was developed in 2007 by me, Alex Mejias, and my buddy, Chris Thomas.
        At the time there wasn't many halfway decent music blogs, and the ones who were decent
        made you put up with their music snobbery (I'm looking at you Pitchfork).
        So our answer? A no bullshit music blog where we have the ability to write whatever we want.
        I invented the single page music playlist site to solve a problem, traditional music blogs required users to
        navigate through their diluted content to actually play a song. We wanted the listening
        experience to be simple, click the post -- hear the song. Our intention was never to review music,
        that was up to the listener. We did, however, want to provide some entertainment and that came
        in the form of our daily antics, opinions, and occasionally a song review.
